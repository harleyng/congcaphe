# CongCafe
### Introduction

* The story of Cong began in 2007. The first shop of the franchise was a small café, situated on Trieu Viet Vuong street – the historic café street of Hanoi.
* The name “Cộng” is simply taken from the first word of Vietnam’s official name: CỘNG HOÀ XÃ HỘI CHỦ NGHĨA VIỆT NAM (The Socialist Republic of Vietnam).
* We are totally in love with CongCafe, so we decide to clone CongCafe's website for this project
